![Sample of the PyCon 2019 Poster](gatorgrouper-poster-pycon2019.png)

This repository contains the LaTeX source code and additional resources for a
poster that [Gregory M. Kapfhammer](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/), with
the support of students in the Department of Computer Science at Allegheny
College, gave at the PyCon 2019 conference. The poster uses the
[rafaelbailo/betterposter-latex-template](https://github.com/rafaelbailo/betterposter-latex-template).
You are welcome to use this source code as inspiration for your own technical
poster. If you find this example useful, could I trouble you to star this
repository and then acknowledge it in your own presentation slides?

You can type the following command if you want to clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gkapfham/pycon2019-gatorgrouper-poster.git
```

Then, if you want to compile the presentation to a PDF, you should type the
following commands.

```shell
cd pycon2019-gatorgrouper-poster
pdflatex gatorgrouper-poster-pycon2019.tex
```

It is worth noting that you can also compile the paper using other LaTeX
development tools, such as `latexmk`. If you are unable to compile the
presentation with your development tools and your execution environment, then
please open a new issue and I will attempt to resolve your concerns.
